# Distance Sampling Examples

Here you can find a set of worked examples ("vignettes") demonstrating various aspects of distance sampling design and analysis using free software tools we have created and maintain. At present they focus on R packages; for examples using Distance for Windows see Chapter 3 ("Getting started") of the Distance manual.

# Examples with R packages

- [Getting started with survey design using `dssd`](dssd-getting-started/GettingStarted.html) Use of the package `dssd` to create a survey design within a study-area, and examine properties of the design such as how well it covers the study area and  average transect lengths.  The example uses a parallel line transects; other designs available in the `dssd` package follow from this example.
- [Multiple strata in `dssd`](dssd-multi-strata/MultiStrataVignette.html) An example of how to create a design in `dssd` that contains multiple strata, with different design characteristics in each stratum.
- [Analysis of line transect data](Distance-lines/line-transects.html) Line transect data of winter wrens in Scotland.  An example of model fitting, model selection, goodness of fit assessment.  Basic analysis skills required for any distance sampling analysis.
