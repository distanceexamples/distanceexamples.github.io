# Distance Sampling Examples

Here you can find a set of wroked examples ("vignettes") demonstrating various aspects of distance sampling design and analysis using free software tools we have created and maintain. At present they focus on R packages; for examples using Distance for Windows see Chapter 3 ("Getting started") of the Distance manual.

# Examples with R packages

- [Getting started with survey design using `dssd`](dssd-getting-started/GettingStarted.html)  Here, we show how to use the package `dssd` to create a survey design within a study-area, and examine properties of the design such as how well it covers the study area and what the average transect lengths are.  The example uses a parallel line, but should give you enough grounding to get started with the other designs available in the `dssd` package.
- [Multiple strata in `dssd`](dssd-multi-strata/MultiStrataVignette.html) An example of how to create a design in `dssd` that contains multiple strata, with different design characteristics in each stratum.
